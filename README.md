# ProjectsTxstSP18

All projects run (they should) in Visual Studio.

All projects are Windows Forms projects. Thus, my work is (on most if not all projects here) the design of the Windows Form and the code behind the Form.cs files.

A few projects may contain some classes, extra forms, etc. that I created.
